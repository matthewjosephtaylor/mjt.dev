"Auto Rail"

Tireless moving

I love the beauty of strong lines over simple colors.

This piece has an almost "line and pastel" feel to my eyes.

Process details: 

This is a large SVG built up of several layers, much like how one would do a traditional painting.

The final SVGs are usually around 50-150mb in size.
 
With each piece I hone the software I&#x27;m crafting to produce the images.
 
The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.
