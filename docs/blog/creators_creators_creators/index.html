    <h1 id="creatorscreatorscreators">Creators Creators Creators</h1>
    <p>
      Why creators are pivotal to chase after, and the platforms that serve
      creators best will win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve Balmer had it right with his mantra
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs"
        >Developers Developers Developers</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the record I am far from a Microsoft/Balmer fanboy. However, props to
      Balmer for getting it, and for providing endless hours of amusement with
      his chant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a developer myself it is nice to be appreciated, but I also saw the
      logic of <em>why</em> Balmer/Microsoft was so focused on developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microsoft realized without full understanding of why, (after all they have
      no sense of taste) a critical fact that was good enough to see them
      through. And good enough is good enough.
    </p>
    <pre><code>The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste. They have absolutely no taste. And I don't mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don't think of original ideas, and they don't bring much culture into their products.
    --- Steve Jobs
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Software Developers <strong>Create</strong> Software, and one wants
      creators creating stuff on <em>their</em> platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple, saw things a little differently. They went after 'creators' writ
      large. They <em>accidentally</em> IMHO attracted developers onto their
      platform, not because they were focused on gaining developers, but because
      they were focused on gaining <em>any</em> digital creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the record, Apple IMHO is losing to the degree it is shifting its
      focus to consumers rather than creators. As a creator I have become
      decreasingly enthused and at times downright frustrated with Apple over
      the years. As a consumer I have been outraged by the walls of their
      garden. Apple is IMHO losing focus and so declining presently. Their crown
      is ripe for the taking.
    </p>
    <h2 id="wherearewetoday">Where are we today?</h2>
    <p>
      As I write these words humanity has largely solved the 'basics' of feeding
      and caring for humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no more natural causes that kill humans in large proportions on
      any regular basis. Politics (human choice) is by far the only reason any
      human goes without food/clothing/shelter/care/entertainment/education (all
      the 'goods' of life) at this point.
    </p>
    <p>Today, humans decide how humans live and die, not nature.</p>
    <p>
      That is a big historical shift. It is exciting, and it is terrifying.
      Humanity has bootstrapped itself and is now running free, on its own, in a
      direction nobody can guess. Our childhood is over. It is fully up to us
      where we will go from here.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whychasecreators">Why Chase Creators?</h2>
    <p>
      As humans have 'broken' from nature the rules have changed. Human survival
      no longer depends on nature, it depends on society and how well one takes
      advantage of the 'human/social space' vs the 'natural/physical space'.
    </p>
    <p>Nature doesn't create. Humans create from nature.</p>
    <p>
      Most things I as a human interact with daily is intentionally (or
      unintentionally) created/shaped by another human or group of humans. My
      house. My food. My water. My physical safety. My understanding and view of
      the world. I look around my room as I type this on my keyboard, and can
      see nothing that doesn't have 'made by human' stamped on it.
    </p>
    <p>I don't live in nature. I live in humanity.</p>
    <p>
      As 'humanity' is the place I live, it is important to
      <em>pay attention</em> to those responsible for its creation, maintenance
      and evolution. Those that create things humans recognize and use are the
      ones called 'creators'.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the modern 'post-nature' era, following and chasing creators is cirital
      to survive and thrive as a human. Human creators are the ones creating
      humanity itself going forward, only a fool would ignore those responsible
      for creating/maintaining their world.
    </p>
    <h2 id="winningstrategies">Winning Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Microsoft and Apple became successful by chasing creators and having those
      creators build within their platforms. Google is successful to the degree
      it allows creative work to be found. Amazon is successful by providing a
      platform/infrastructure allowing the transportation of creative work to
      flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business today is all about <em>creating</em> platforms and services that
      <em>creators</em> can <em>use</em> to be
      <em>successful themselves</em> creating and distributing their creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the important question to ask is: What does a
      <em>creator</em> desire/need? The ones that are better at answering that
      question will win more creators, and so will survive and thrive.
    </p>
    <h2 id="darktimescreateopportunities">Dark Times Create Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      The stifling of creative freedom is what I believe will mark the present
      era.
    </p>
    <p>
      Censorship is rampant as I write these words. It is even to a degree
      celebrated and sought after. A natural reaction, no doubt, to the rapid
      pace of change. Also a useful tool of maintaining power and control, and
      so self-perpetuating.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me living in the present time it feels similar, I imagine, to the times
      when human slavery was celebrated as an institution. An 'evil' is wrapped
      within some 'greater good' (a good trick, and one to be wary of) but the
      absurdity of the situation and inherent self-inconsistency makes the world
      seem 'broken' in a weird way that obviously can't maintain itself. But it
      is hard to predict how long until the inconsistency is resolved.
    </p>
    <pre><code>"The stock market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.‚Äù -- John Maynard Keynes
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Any form of censorhip is anti-creative, the opposite of create is to
      censor not destroy, which itself just creates a new creation of the
      destroyed thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being 'anti-creative' is a currently popular, but long-term losing
      strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anytime there is something popular but fleeting it is possible to 'short
      sell', aka benefit by betting on its eventual decline, <em>if</em> one has
      the patience and fortitude to stick it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything that unlocks a new bit of human creativity/expression is IMHO
      unstopably powerful. If there is any 'guaranteed winning' strategy,
      betting on anything that provides humans with more creative/expressive
      power is a 'sure thing' in the long run as far as I can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even if it is a losing strategy in some sense, as a human 'creator' I
      feel compelled to bet on increasing human creativity, as it feels like I'm
      betting on my own success. It is a bet on the direction I personally
      <em>want</em> humanity to go. So even if the bet on human creativity
      winning somehow 'loses' in any sort of 'survival' sense, I still feel
      compelled to throw my chips in this direction. My own personal aesthetic
      is that I think more creativity/expression is a somehow 'prettier'
      humanity, vs a less creative/expressive humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel opposition to this direction can happen short-term as humans
      explore, but the evolutionary stable solution has always been in the
      direction of anything that provides greater human creativity, as I read
      history. So even for pure survival reasons I think this is a good bet.
      Maybe that is why in fact I <em>feel</em> like it is a good bet? Nature
      seems to think 'survival' is a beautiful trait, and so I'm 'wired' to find
      this attractive :).
    </p>
    <h2 id="decentralizationcentralizationcommunicationandprivacy">
      Decentralization, Centralization, Communication and Privacy
    </h2>
    <p>
      For decades there has been an understanding that decentralization is a key
      ingredient to making anything long-term stable, from services to
      communications (the internet began as a military defense protocol). Having
      <em>multiple</em> redundant providers is important for 'keeping the lights
      on'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Centralization and hierarchies are good at speed and efficiency.
      Businesses, militaries, and sports teams are pure command and control
      hierarchies for this reason. My very body is a command/control system. My
      hand types these words without questioning 'why' it is doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present internet is a combination of centralized and decentralized
      protocols. While opposites, centralization and decentralization are clear
      winning strategies. At the end of the day winning and being successful is
      more important than purity if one wants to survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figuring out the best <em>combination</em> of strategies is where all the
      action is at. Few successful artists limit themselves to the use of only
      one color of paint.
    </p>
    <h2 id="emergingwinners">Emerging Winners</h2>
    <p>
      The internet 'won'. It won because it unlocked a torrent of human
      creativity. There was resistance to it from the start (remember when the
      internet was criticized as only useful for porn? ), but 30 years on, it is
      clear it will remain and grow and thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a surge of adoption in the late 1990's / early 2000's sometimes
      called the 'dot com bubble'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet was around for years before it became 'popular' and useful.
      There was a technology that unlocked the internet called the 'browser'. To
      many no doubt their browser <em>is</em> the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The browser won because it allowed web 1.0 (static web) to become web 2.0
      (interactive web) thus making the internet/web easy and useful for
      ordinary people. This led to rapid sudden adoption and so to the 'bubble'
      which burst into a deep ocean.
    </p>
    <p>Now is the time for web 3.0 (distributed web).</p>
    <p>
      Like web 2.0 building on top of and retaining all of web 1.0, web 3.0
      builds on top of 2.0 and adds a critical new feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The critical feature is <em>meaningful</em> and
      <em>easy</em> decentralization of the production, distribution, and
      transacting of goods and services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans 'broke away' from nature, but of course still live within it. Human
      society lives 'on top' of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way web 3.0 is humans breaking away from the social institutions that
      are no longer useful. Institutions that limit human freedom and creativity
      will be among the first to go. But in general, any institution that has
      become too focused on serving the institution itself is ripe for
      transition to the blockchain. Institutions under this new paradigm now
      have to <em>compete</em> for adoption by humans, and competition is what
      drives increasing quality by and large.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel like we are presently in the 'dot com' era of this new wave of
      fundamental human transformation. I don't use those words lightly.
    </p>
    <p>Cities <em>transformed</em> humanity.</p>
    <p>The steam engine <em>transformed</em> humanity.</p>
    <p>The computer <em>transformed</em> humanity.</p>
    <p>The internet <em>transformed</em> humanity.</p>
    <p>The decentralized web will also <em>transform</em> humans.</p>
    <p>
      Each transformation builds upon the previous by 'freeing' it in some way
      from the shackles of the layer underneath, and providing more 'power' for
      those wielding the new tools the transformation provides.
    </p>
    <p>Cities freed us from the brutality of nomadic existence.</p>
    <p>
      The Steam engine (aka heat engine) freed us from human and animal physical
      labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The computer freed us from having to do all mental calculation inside the
      human brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet freed us from having to communicate to only our immediately
      available interlocutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decentralized web will free us from having to ask permission to
      create.
    </p>
    <h2 id="strikewhiletheironishot">Strike While the Iron is Hot</h2>
    <p>
      Like previous transformations, the transformation itself happens both
      quickly and slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because the transformation is a gift that keeps on giving. Cities
      are one of the oldest transformations, and even today we continue to find
      new creative ways of using them. Same with engines, computers, the
      internet, etc‚Ä¶
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'newer' the transformation is the 'hotter' the iron and so the easier
      it is to make an impact on it that will be long lasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      IMHO the temperature of web 3.0 is 'white hot' and the iron is still
      mostly liquid, but there are some structures that are begining to form and
      can be leveraged and built upon today.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Blockchain techs. In particular 'smart' blockchains that have an
          element of computation to them. Ethereum is the granddaddy. Like
          C/Unix It will form the pattern others are built on top of. I feel
          strongly there will continue to be many many others to follow, but
          they will all be strongly influenced in how they interface by this
          project. More 'pure' chains that are good at high transaction rates
          also win. Interoperability between chains, and in general reducing
          transaction costs are going to become increasingly important as
          thousands and millions of chains bloom.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          P2P data transfer techs. IPFS has asserted dominance in this space. It
          forms the underlying infrastructure that allows truly distributed
          long-term 'static' communications. It has potential to be one of the
          future primary open internet protocols like HTTP and SMTP. Its a
          hidden thing only developers will find interest in, but it is a
          critical piece of the puzzle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Platforms built using these above technologies. This is where the
          everything is iron in steam form, not even a liquid. Looking around I
          see very few applications that will remain viable, but many proofs of
          concepts that are indeed proving themselves.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Games that are building upon NFTs are such an example. There are
          several, none are particularly compelling, but they are here today and
          working and capturing significant time and attention. They are proving
          the ecosystem is viable and that is enough for what they are.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          NFTs for digital art. I think the pricing is out of line for all but
          the most seminal works, but there are some gems that are vanguards for
          the new medium.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          NFTs for supply chain management. Very boring and will be very
          profitable. The first viable B2B usecase.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      If one is creative there has never been a more exciting time to be alive.
      Get out there, use the new (or better, combination of new and old) tools
      being provided and make something that sings with your soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society is on the verge of a new transformation that will see creatives of
      all stripes richly rewarded for their efforts with increasing pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one is looking for business ideas, creating tools and resources that
      helps creators create has been, and will increasingly be, a rewarding
      activity in itself.
    </p>
    <p>Chase the creators and chase creativity. That is how the humans do.</p>
