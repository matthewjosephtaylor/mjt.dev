"Reality Unleashed"

The world is more than it appears


I love how the colors dance and sing on this piece.

The unusual pallet produces a lot of interest to what otherwise might be a boring scene.

The sky is where all the real action is. 

Highly recommend taking a look at the high-res image on my website for this one.

Process details: 

I'm using custom software I'm developing to produce these images.

Typescript, and HTML canvas are my present foundational tools, my virtual equivalents of traditional brushes, pigment and surface.

I sample from reference images and 'extract' different things from them (colors, shapes, textures, etc...).

I then refine and recombine the 'extracts' looking for something that speaks to me.

Often I'm programming at the same time, tweaking and adding new processing capabilities to the software.

The end result is a large SVG built up of several layers.

Each layer serves a specific visual purpose, much like how one would do a traditional painting (underpainting, tone, line, etc..).

The final SVG is usually around 50-150mb in size.
 
The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.
