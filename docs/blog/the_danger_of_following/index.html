      I had a nightmare the other night that lead me to a valuable realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nightmare I was walking in a barely tamed natural park. There was a
      path, and there were park rangers, but it was a place still wild with
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember high cliff walls, a sense that while I was in no immediate
      danger, I wasn't quite comfortable, and wanted to get out of the park. I
      was bored, and had a vague sense of unease from the incomprehensible
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was following the path and came to realize that an old girlfriend was
      with me. Someone I cared for and wanted to protect. We broke up years ago,
      but in that way dreams have a habbit of doing, I was made aware she was
      always with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasant being with her, and it made the journey enjoyable, simply
      to walk the path with her. It was nice. We walked for some time, plesantly
      enjoying one anther's company and admiring the surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following rules was not one of my girlfriend's talents. She wondered
      somewhat off the path, chasing something I know not what. I then chased
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The park rangers showed up and began the process of detaining my
      companion. As any good boyfriend would, I too began to struggle with the
      park rangers, defending my old love. It didn't matter what she was
      chasing, now <em>I</em> was in the fight for it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I struggled, trying my best to untangle the mess, it struck me that I
      was fighting for an ultimate cause that I was ignorant of. I was being
      pulled into fighting for whatever my love was chasing. If she would but
      cease chasing, the park rangers would let her go, and we could go along
      our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was stubborn, and I could not reason with her, because I did not
      understand what she was after. I was left with the simple choice of
      fighting for her, because she was the one <em>I</em> was chasing. Her
      struggle became mine and so I found myself fighting for an end cause I
      ultimately had no faith in, but for which I would fight regardless.
    </p>
    <p>Upon waking, the poignancy of the realization stuck with me.</p>
    <h1 id="realization">Realization</h1>
    <p>
      Long ago I gave myself permission to be happy in the light of my own
      ignorance. I was not disturbed that I was fighting for a cause I did not
      understand. I was amused by the idea that I was 'tricked' into fighting
      the battle that was not my own, could not be my own, and had no way of
      getting out of, other than to <em>abandon</em> my love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nightmare is the <em>real</em> choice, when it appears, of abandoning
      what one loves, as the pain of an incomprehensible struggle becomes
      greater and greater. I woke up in horror when I realized I had a choice to
      abandon what I loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It strikes me that I put a lot of thought in what <em>I</em> want, but
      have not really thought as much about what the things I want, want
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is that as I chase and embrace things, I am <em>forced</em> to
      chase and embrace whatever my love itself chases.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go down the rabbit hole chasing the rabbit. The rabbit has its own
      agenda. The rabbit's agenda, regardless of if I agree with it, becomes
      mine, to the degree I want the rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more I love/want something, the harder it is to give up on it. Often
      pursuit brings struggle, and the horrible choice of giving up the chase is
      always on offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rabbits have a habbit of jumping into dark holes. Those holes can lead to
      mysterious and wonderful places, and they can lead to bleak and terrible
      ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've come to the point of chasing for the love of the chase, and accepting
      that some chases will end when the love is lost, which is to say: when I'm
      forced to abandon that part of myself. Perhaps the worst of life's
      choices. Still I chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair warning to park rangers: I don't give up the things I love easily.
