"Old Town"

Spending a lazy afternoon watching the flow of people

Process details: 

This is a large SVG built up of several layers, much like how one would do a traditional painting.
The final SVGs are usually around 50-150mb in size (pity my GPU that has to carry this weight).

The SVG is produced with custom software I'm developing.
 
With each piece I hone the software, as I'm honing the final image.
 
The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.

A lot of my process is simply looking at a wide variety of awesome art.

As I see something interesting I try to figure out how it is done.
 
I then noodle on the problem of how what the _essence_ of the technique is, and how I can achieve similar affect in my software.

I modify the software to give me artistic 'primitives' that capture the essence of a style or technique.

Wether I succeed or fail in my attempts at reproduction I often learn a great deal, and almost always come up with something interesting (sometimes in a completely different direction).
 
I then choose what and how to mix these primitives together as I come to create a particular piece.

Over time I'm building the tool that allows me to produce the images you see.

I feel with each new image I learn something more about how art works, and become more capable of producing work I enjoy.
