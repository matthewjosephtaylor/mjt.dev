"Moment"

Where were you then?


Lines and shadows.

How much of the beauty of the world do we miss by being so emersed in it?

Like a fish unaware of water, I often forget to be flabbergasted that the world exists.

It is of course OK to forget this. Living and being part of the world is its own thing.

But it is nice from time to time to pluck a moment from time, and admire it for itself.


Process details: 

I'm using custom software I'm developing to produce these images.

Typescript, and HTML canvas are my present foundational tools, my virtual equivalents of traditional brushes, pigment and surface.

I sample from reference images and 'extract' different things from them (colors, shapes, textures, etc...).

I then refine and recombine the 'extracts' looking for something that speaks to me.

Often I'm programming at the same time, tweaking and adding new processing capabilities to the software.

The end result is a large SVG built up of several layers.

Each layer serves a specific visual purpose, much like how one would do a traditional painting (underpainting, tone, line, etc..).

The final SVG is usually around 50-150mb in size.
 
The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.
