    <h3>About Matthew Joseph Taylor</h3>
    <p>
      I was born and currently reside in the United States. Early in life I
      discovered I had an affinity with math, science, and computers. I attended
      Texas Tech University to study Engineering Physics.
    </p>

    <p>Learning is a dangerous activity.</p>

    <p>
      I've always had a sincere attitude towards life. I studied physics with an
      eye towards practical application. I wanted to learn how the universe
      truly worked. The nuts and bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time a friend introduced me to an idea that forever changed my
      life. The concept was
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems"
        >Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say my dreams of what I wanted in life were shattered is an
      understatement. I cared for nothing. I lost the will to face life. I
      dropped out of university. I did not have the stomach for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As luck would have it, I found myself living in a time and place that
      richly rewards those with an interest in math and computation. I coded to
      live, and lived to code.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 20+ years I worked off and on as a software developer. Checkout my
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewjosephtaylor">linked-in</a>
      for the full details of my professional career. I had a break in the early
      2000's to pursue selling paintings on eBay, but eventually returned to
      software. On the side I thought and read much on the topics of physics,
      math, and philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many years I found peace with Gödel. I found my meaning of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know what this place is, but I've found a way to be happy without
      knowing. I wake up every day in pure amazement that
      <b>anything</b> exists. It is such a gift, that I have no words to
      describe it. I live in this moment with a heart full gratitude for this
      truly astounding gift of being alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I find myself taking another break from the world of corporate
      software development. I woke up one day and discovered I no longer had the
      stomach for it. Life is too precious to waste on things one isn't
      interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I'm returning to creating art . I can think of no better way to spend
      the moments of my life than engaging with life directly, and there is no
      more direct means of engagement that I'm aware of.
