"Open All Night"

The city provides for all its residents without judgement

Nightime in has a bit of evil about it.

As we struggle to fight the encroaching darkness, the light we create somehow hides more than it reveals.

The harsh lights illuminate without warmth. A cold dead light.

Yet, if one finds oneself out and about of an evening, there is a sense of delight in the danger.

A safety in the shadows. One can relax, take off the mask and just be.

Process details: 

I'm using custom software I'm developing to produce these images.

Typescript, and HTML canvas are my present foundational tools, my virtual equivalents of traditional brushes, pigment and surface.

I sample from reference images and 'extract' different things from them (colors, shapes, textures, etc...).

I then refine and recombine the 'extracts' looking for something that speaks to me.

Often I'm programming at the same time, tweaking and adding new processing capabilities to the software.

The end result is a large SVG built up of several layers.

Each layer serves a specific visual purpose, much like how one would do a traditional painting (underpainting, tone, line, etc..).

The final SVG is usually around 50-150mb in size.
 
The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.
