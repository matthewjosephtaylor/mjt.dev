    <p>Non-Fungible Token</p>
    <p>
      Here is the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token"
        >wikipedia page</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>But what does it <em>mean</em>?.</p>
    <p>And <em>meaning</em> is the key here.</p>
    <p>What does it <em>mean</em> to <em>own</em> something?</p>
    <p>
      According to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership">wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <pre><code>Ownership is the state or fact of exclusive rights and control over property...
</code></pre>
    <p>
      What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property">property</a>?
    </p>
    <pre><code>Property (latin: Res Privata) in the abstract is what belongs to or with something...
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Did you question my use of wikipedia to provide meaning to those words?
    </p>
    <p>I doubt it.</p>
    <p>
      This is because wikipedia has become
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)"
        ><em>legitimate</em></a
      >.
    </p>
    <pre><code>In political science, legitimacy is the right and acceptance of an authority...
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Once upon a time that was not so. I remember that time, and that time has
      passed. We now live in the age of wikipedia as a legitimate source of
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important thing to note with wikipedian legitimacy is that it didn't
      happen all at once. It accumulated. Slowly, article by article, mind by
      mind until suddenly (seemingly overnight) the balance of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority"><em>authority</em></a>
      changed.
    </p>
    <pre><code>In the fields of sociology and political science, authority is the legitimate power that a person or a group of persons consensually possess and practice over other people.
</code></pre>
    <p>
      In 2021 can one <em>afford</em> to question the legitimate authority of
      wikipedia as a source of knowledge?
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2021 is it affordable to continue to question the legitimacy of
      cryptocurrencies as a means of ownership?
    </p>
    <p>
      For many I believe the tipping point will be seen as
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-auction-christie-s-nft/digital-only-artwork-fetches-nearly-70-million-at-christies-idUSKBN2B3275"

        >Christies</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my mind that was something of a 'moon landing' event. Can't go back to
      before. The world is a different place now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monetary amount in this case is important in that it made a
      sensational story, but the fact that <em>Christies</em> legitimized the
      transaction is <em>crucial</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years it has been possible to (and people have) traded NFTs and
      NFT-like contracts using blockchain transactions.
    </p>
    <p>For those keeping up with this technology, this is <em>old</em> news.</p>
    <p>
      And <em>old</em> is also part of the key here. As in <em>old people</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Kuhn famously coined the phrase
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift">'paradigm shift'</a
      >.
    </p>
    <pre><code>A paradigm shift, a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn, is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline
</code></pre>
    <p>
      In the book
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions"
        >The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a
      >
      Kuhn made the sad discovery that scientists <em>hold on</em>, to beliefs
      they formed early in their lives, and <em>dont'</em> change their minds on
      core principles as new evidence and theories form. Science advances
      largely only as the old scientists die, and are replaced by the next
      generation who aren't locked into the old ways of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't to <em>blame</em> those scientists. Scientists are after all
      human, and the human mind seems to work in such a way as to
      <em>fix</em> ones view of the world early in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, it is today widely recognized that the Earth travels
      around the Sun, and Quatum Mechanics is legit science. Remember, Einstein
      famously thought QM was 'spooky', and challenged it, even though he opened
      the door for it with his previous work. This isn't about intellectual
      capability, it's about human psychology.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whatdoesitmeanto_own_something">
      What does it mean to <em>own</em> something?
    </h2>
    <p>I <em>own</em> a vehicle. It sits in my garage.</p>
    <p>
      If someone were to break my garage door down and run away with my vehicle
      would I still <em>own</em> it?
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way, yes. If it was ever recovered I could claim it as mine. And
      during the time of its loss I would certainly <em>feel</em> as though I
      was the legitimate owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the time when <em>my</em> vehicle was being driven by the
      thief, in practice the thief has greater ownership of the vehicle in that
      they have <em>possession</em> of it.
    </p>
    <p>So what makes the vehicle mine or the property of the thief?</p>
    <p>
      In practical terms, it is the ability to maintain <em>control</em> over
      the property over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thief, as they are able to continue to drive around with my car (maybe
      they are clever and give it a new paint job and fake license plate) will
      feel as if <em>they</em> own the vehicle (and will no doubt be annoyed if
      it is stolen from them in turn).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in the eyes of <em>the law and society</em> I would still be the
      owner if/when the vehicle was ever to be discovered. My
      <em>symbolic</em> ownership <em>trumps</em> the temporary physical
      ownership in the long term. There are even special sub-groups within
      society often called called 'police' that will carry out physical
      enforcement of this symbolic ownership. This a <em>key benefit</em> of
      living in a society vs as a lone wonderer, and why humans have done so for
      thousands of years. I recommend it, and I'm not aware of any humans alive
      today that have a choice but to be a member of such a society.
    </p>
    <p>
      This symbolic ownership is done via a system of record keeping. Honda,
      created the vehicle, and with it a unique identifier (called a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number"
        >VIN</a
      >) that they stamped on the frame. They then sold the vehicle/VIN to a
      dealer who sold it to me. It is the ownership of the VIN (the number, not
      the thing stamped into the frame) that makes the vehicle <em>mine</em>.
      For cars, ownership is NOT the physical possession of the hunk of glass
      and steel, it is owning a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I will interject to make the claim that mathematical locks and keys
      are stronger than any physical lock and key, and likely always will be. It
      is certainly stronger than any lock and key that currently protects any of
      my physical possessions. I believe most would protect their possesions
      with such locks and keys if they were able.
    </p>
    <p>
      VINs and deeds work for houses and cars, and no reasonable person
      questions it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whatdoesitmeanto_own_somethinginthedigitalworldisthatevenpossible">
      What does it mean to <em>own</em> something in the digital world? Is that
      even possible?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes. In fact I would claim that is how the <em>majority</em> of ownership
      and human existence happens in the modern era.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans <em>already</em> live in a non-physical world for the most part.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would argue that
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism"
        >Social Constructs</a
      >
      are largely what humans live within.
    </p>
    <pre><code>A social construct or construction is the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by the inhabitants of that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event.
</code></pre>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Is money physical?</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Where is the physical <em>body</em> of a corporation?</p>
      </li>

          What invisible hand touches most adults causing them to leave their
          beds and houses roughly at the same time each the morning (for 5 of
          the 7 days of the week (what an odd cycle)). Causing them to leave
          friends and loved ones, to spend most of their precious time
          <em>working</em> for a goals they largely do not understand, or
          perhaps even agree with, voluntarily?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Just as it would have been laughable for a caveman to recognize my
      'ownership' of my home when I signed a piece of paper…it is laughable to
      many today to recognize 'ownership' of an item on the blockchain, signed
      by a cryptographic function (which is much, much harder to forge). But is
      it so different?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no more cavemen left alive. Their children inhereted the Earth
      upon which we all stand today. Those children grow up and have 'crazy'
      ideas that are no longer crazy, because all those that thought they were
      crazy have passed on. Crazy 'paper-signing' vs good old-fashioned 'I beat
      you with club if I see you take' is today the normal means of signifying
      ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of ownership, especially expensive item ownership, is already
      largely symbolic. I have a very few <em>personal</em> possessions that I
      would physically fight for, and physically protect using my own two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most <em>expensive</em> possessions (house, vehicle, banking account,
      etc…) are <em>already</em> 'owned' in a purely symbolic way, that my
      caveman ancestors would not recognize as legitimate, but
      <em>most</em> alive today (thankfully) would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question then in my mind becomes <em>when</em> not
      <em>if</em> cryptocurrencies/NFTs will become the dominant means of
      symbolizing ownership for humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do think it will take time. The old will need to pass on, as I don't
      think they will accept such a large change. But as they pass, their
      children will (I think) prefer the speed, safety, efficiency and just raw
      power to be had by owning via blockchain vs the current archaic systems we
      have today (<em>cough</em> title insurance <em>cough</em>).

          Fractional ownership of more-or-less anything. This is important for
          the same reason that corporations sell millions of <em>shares</em> of
          stock: liquidity. The universal grease of economics. The gears of
          economics are going to start turning at

          Original creators of a good can benifit from all grey-market sales.
          Token contracts can be written in ways that
          <em>mandate in code</em> that a portion of the sale goes back to the
          original creator whenever a token is transferred. Quite attractive if
          one is selling a good that is likely to trade hands over time. Think
          'my own private sales tax'. A huge incentive for goods producers to do
          what they can to <em>increase</em> the value of their old goods
          <em>after</em> the sale. Crazy talk.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The owners of a creator's work can now directly benifit from
          supporting the artist over the span of their career, for a wider
          variety of artforms such as music and games. Suddenly having a keen
          eye of an up and coming talent and supporting them by buying their
          music, game, blogpost, tweet, etc. can reap real rewards down the
          line, if that creator 'takes off'. A used t-shirt isn't going to sell
          for much, and today there is no way to resell an mp3 from iTunes, but
          an NFT of an early mp3 NFT bought from the artist early in their
          career could be worth quite a bit. This encourages everyone to be on
          the lookout for new talent, and more importantly to
          <em>financially support new talent</em> as long as one sees
          <em>potential</em>. It also encourages <em>all creators</em> to be as
          creative and produce as much as they can, and 'sell cheap' early in
          their careers without stigma (remember how the grey market sales
          work).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A provenance system for art that makes it <em>trivial</em> to verify
          ownership over large spans of time (hundreds, perhaps thousands of
          years (maybe much longer)). Longer than most physical art is likely to
          stand up to the ravages of time, and importantly with
          <em>zero</em> storage costs. IMHO This is why Beeple's jpg sold for
          $69 million. This is the core of why the rich buy art. To store and
          preserve <em>long term</em> wealth. Anything that would knock out the
          blockchain at this point would likely end humanity first. "The First
          5000 Days" has real potential to outlast the Mona Lisa (which has
          almost been destroyed several times by vandals over the years). The
          rich have spoken, and it looks like they are voting for NFTs (and for
          solid reasons, nobody gives 60+ million to a relatively unknown artist
          on a lark).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The value of any NFT token is <em>independent</em> of the value of the
          blockchain, which can swing widely day to day. That is 101 of what an
          NFT is, and is in a sense its 'killer feature'. Value of an NFT is
          purely in the hands/minds of the market for that
          <em>particular</em> NFT, regardless as the price of the underlying
          blockchain. This means one can have confidence that what one
          <em>owns</em> will <em>retain</em> its value as long as the thing
          itself is valueable. One isn't betting on if Ethereum will hold value.
          One is betting on if the artist, song, image, game item, etc… will
          hold, which is a much easier thing to reason about and understand (one
          generally knows a thing or two about the things one chooses to
          purchase). Few understand the details of the vast and complex systems
          underlying the Visa payment network, but everyone knows what kind of
          music, books, and and games they like.

    <h2 id="howtotakeadvantage">How to take advantage</h2>
    <p>
      It is hard to predict what exactly will win as 'everything changes' again,
      but I think <em>exposure</em> and smartly embracing change vs recoiling
      and rejecting is an overall winning strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't be afraid to loose. Loosing is part of learning, and few gains come
      without at least some losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be a bit afraid. This <em>will</em> bring change and disruption. Think
      about what will happen as people move away from those social constructs
      around ownership one may presently hold dear towards new ones that seem
      indecipherable, and foreign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be a bit excited. As the old trees die they leave room for new growth.
      Striving for that new light can be lot of fun.

      Reach out if you have questions. I've been following the cryptocurrency
      space for about a decade, and am happy to share my perspective to those
      just arriving.
