  "notes": "Process details: \n This is a large SVG built up of several layers, much like how one would do a traditional painting.\n The final SVGs are usually around 50-100mb in size (pity my GPU that has to carry this weight).\n \n With each piece I hone the software, as I'm honing the final image.\n \n The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.\n\n I find lots of inspiration from other artistic works, especially modern artists on IG.\n A lot of my process is simply looking at a wide variety of awesome art.\n\n As I see something interesting I try to figure out how it is done.\n \n I then noodle on the problem of how what the _essence_ of the technique is and how I can achieve similar affect in my software.\n\n I modify the software to give me artistic 'primitives' that capture the essence of a style or technique.\n\n Wether I succeed or fail in my attempts at reproduction I often learn a great deal, and almost always come up with something interesting (sometimes in a completely different direction).\n \n I then choose what and how to mix these primitives together as I come to create a particular piece.\n\n Over time I'm building the tool that allows me to produce the images you see.\n\n I feel with each new image I learn something more about how art works, and become more capable of producing work I find good.\n  ",
