"Decisions"

What would the world be without choice?



I think there is a lot to be said in this style of art.

Perhaps it is just the infatuation of the moment, but I'm starting to feel the groove of it.

That magical feeling when everthing one touches turns to gold. 

Every move changes direction, but there don't seem be any wrong paths.

I'm in that zone of loving the art I'm creating.

I feel empowered by the feeling I have the ability to create art that I enjoy. 

Process details: 

I'm using custom software I'm developing to produce these images.

Typescript, and HTML canvas are my present foundational tools, my virtual equivalents of traditional brushes, pigment and surface.

I sample from reference images and 'extract' different things from them (colors, shapes, textures, etc...).

I then refine and recombine the 'extracts' looking for something that speaks to me.

Often I'm programming at the same time, tweaking and adding new processing capabilities to the software.

The end result is a large SVG built up of several layers.

Each layer serves a specific visual purpose, much like how one would do a traditional painting (underpainting, tone, line, etc..).

The final SVG is usually around 50-150mb in size.
 
The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.
