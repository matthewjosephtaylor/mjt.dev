"Place to Place"

Do we move, or does the world move?

I note a sense of patient waiting with this one.

This is the 3rd tram/trolly that I've done recently. Feels like the beginnings of a potential series

It is nice to have a consistent subject as I do my daily practice.

I'm not sure how I stumbled upon trams, but I'm finding it works well as a central motif.

As I've brought more detailed line-work in, I'm tending away from abstraction, which feels like a change.

I know I want to follow consistent content, and assume others do as well.

I'm toying with the idea of spinning off new IG accounts to allow more focus particular subjects.

Currently I'm thinking of accounts for the following:

- 'pure' abstraction (no identifyable content)
- 'impure' abstraction (abstract, but with some identifyable content)
- technical experimentation (more comp science than art)
- more realism focused on a consistent style+subject

Curious if any of my followers have an opinion on this.

Process details: 

This is a large SVG built up of several layers, much like how one would do a traditional painting.

The final SVGs are usually around 50-150mb in size.
 
With each piece I hone the software I&#x27;m crafting to produce the images.
 
The balance between programming and art I find pleases my soul.
